## How to Prepare for IT Job Market?

This is a summary of the link below:

Preparation for the labor market is done through skills, which are (a set of knowledge + continuous practice) and the accumulation of skills becomes experience. Among the negatives of specializing in the field of information technology is the rapid change and overlapping of fields. As for the positives, the jobs in this field are among the best jobs, and also the financial aspect is very good, as well as the many opportunities and the possibility of self-learning without the need for a teacher and the most prominent specializations in this field are / computer science - computer engineering - Software engineering - information systems - information technology

 There are two career tracks, the first is the academic track, which needs research and teaching skills. As for the second track, it is industrial and requires practice skills and professional certificates. The industrial track has several tracks that fall into it: the software development track - the database track - the networking track - the cybersecurity track - the track Institutional systems and there are new paths that have emerged in recent years, the most famous of which are (data science - artificial intelligence) and to prepare for the labor market, as the university is not enough because there is a gap between the labor market and the university, and the most important reasons for this gap are (teacher - student - scientific subject - environment) and to address this gap it is necessary to learn One of the main principles for developing capabilities and skills (goal - ambition - honor - focus - self-encouragement - self-education - seriousness - patience). There is an initiative to facilitate self-education in software engineering, which is a website called Al-Murshid. And the framework of the software engineering mentor initiative is (the learner - methodology - techniques) and to evaluate your performance during self-learning (giving presentations - reviewing the applications you have created - taking professional certificates) and choosing your career path is based on your passion and also based on your grades and also Take tests to determine your tendencies.
